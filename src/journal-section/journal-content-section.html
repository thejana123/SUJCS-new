                                included in section numbering. All headings of subsections should be bold.</p>

                            <p>Numbers for displayed equations should be placed in parentheses at the right margin.
                                References to equations should use the form "Eq. (3)" or simply"(3)".</p>
                            <p><strong>Figures</strong></p>
                            <p>Figures should be in a finished form suitable for publication. Number figures with Arabic
                                numerals, and indicate the top and the authors on the back of each figure. Lettering on
                                drawings should be professional quality or generated by high-resolution computer
                                graphics and must be large enough to withstand appropriate reduction for publication.
                                Figures should not be embedded in the text. Digital artwork of at least 300 dpi
                                resolution is accepted in eps or TIFF formats. Please visit our Web site at

                                list (and vice versa). Any references cited in the abstract must be given in full.
                                Unpublished results and personal communications are not recommended in the reference
                                list, but may be mentioned in the text. If these references are included in the
                                reference list they should follow the standard reference style of the journal and should
                                include a substitution of the publication date with either 'Unpublished results' or
                                'Personal communication'. Citation of a reference as 'in press' implies that the item
                                has been accepted for publication.</p>

                                source publication, etc.), should also be given. Web references can be listed separately
                                (e.g., after the reference list) under a different heading if desired, or can be
                                included in the reference list.</p>

                            <p>This journal encourages you to cite underlying or relevant datasets in your manuscript by
                                citing them in your text and including a data reference in your Reference List. Data
                                references should include the following elements: author name(s), dataset title, data
                                repository, version (where available), year, and global persistent identifier. Add
                                [dataset] immediately before the reference so we can properly identify it as a data
                                reference. The [dataset] identifier will not appear in your published article</p>
